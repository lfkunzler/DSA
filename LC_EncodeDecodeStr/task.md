# Description
```
Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a single string. The encoded string is then decoded back to the original list of strings.
```

# Approach
```
Using a length-value approach and considering the constraint of 200 characters maximum per string, we add 3 chars for each string in the encoding function.
