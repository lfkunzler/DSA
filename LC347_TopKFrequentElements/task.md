 Description
```
Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.
```

# Approach
```
1. We can use a hash map to count where the key is the element and the value is the counter.
```

## Time complexity
O(n) for the first part

## Space complexity
O(m) for the first part, where m <= n.
